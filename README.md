# bmp

A simple program written to test out some of the new features of
[SDL3](https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL3).  It can display [BMP
images](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BMP_file_format) and apply some simple
filters to them.

## Installation

Ensure that `pkg-config` and `SDL3` are installed, then run `make`.
